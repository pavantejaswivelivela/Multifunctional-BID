MBID is an idea generation system for generating unique multifunctional and multiscale conceptual designs. The Idea generation system comprises five components namely
1. **BIKAS**: Bio-inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum, a knowledge database for abstraction of functions exhibited by biological features.
2. **Domain Integrated Design (DID)**: A method based on classification and integration of biological features based on their geometric designations.
3. **Meta-level design parameters**: Quantitative parameters for the selection between the biological features that exhibit the same function.
4. **Expandable Domain Integration Design (xDID)**: An extension of DID and a model representation of the ideation system.
5. **Verification**: Generation of unique multifunctional bio-inspired conceptual designs for verification of the system.

### How does this work?



### BIKAS

BIKAS abbreviated as Bio-inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum is a knowledge database developed to represent functions exhibited by biological features at their **embodiment-level** i.e. at their physical structure level. The function exhibited by the biological features is defined as a combination of integrated structure and structural strategy. Where the integrated structure here is defined as the multiscale structure.
