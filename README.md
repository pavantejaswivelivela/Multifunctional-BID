**MBID** is an idea generation system for generating unique multifunctional and multiscale conceptual designs. The Idea generation system comprises five components namely

1. **BIKAS**: Bio-inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum, a knowledge database for abstraction of functions exhibited by biological features.
2. **Domain Integrated Design (DID)**: A method based on classification and integration of biological features based on their geometric designations.
3. **Meta-level design parameters**: Quantitative parameters for the selection between the biological features that exhibit the same function.
4. **Expandable Domain Integration Design (xDID)**: An extension of DID and a model representation of the ideation system.
5. **Verification**: Generation of unique multifunctional bio-inspired conceptual designs for verification of the system.

### BIKAS
### Online interactive web application: [BIKAS](https://bikas.onrender.com/)

BIKAS abbreviated as Bio-inspired Knowledge Acquisition and Simulacrum is a knowledge database developed to represent functions exhibited by biological features at their **embodiment-level** i.e. at their physical structure level. The function exhibited by the biological features is defined as a combination of integrated structure and structural strategy. Where the integrated structure here is defined as the multiscale structure.

1. **Biological Features**: The morphological and anatomical features observed in plant and animal kingdoms. 
2. **Biological Feature characteristics**: Describe a feature’s appearance, apparent form, or physical trait.
3. **Integrated Structure**: represents the physical description of a multiscale structure (e.g., Micro/ Nanostructure, Macrostructure, and the presence of wax layers on the Structure, etc.)
4. **Structural Strategy**: represents the integrated structural configuration (e.g., arrangement of the micro/nanostructure, packing of the micro/nanostructure, orientation of micro/nanostructure, symmetry, asymmetry, or patterns of 
 tessellations, etc.) and changes in the structural configuration due to stimulus. Stimulus is by the other interacting elements connected to the structure (e.g., erection of scales, change in skin compliance, etc.)

### DID and x DID

**Domain Integrated Design (DID)**: is a method that facilitates the classification and mapping of biological features that exhibit various functions. 
1. **Classification**: The biological features are classified by their feature characteristics into their respective geometric designations named as Domains. The domains are namely, Surfaces, Cellular Structures, Shapes and Cross-sections. Domains represent different biological features performing various functions with a common geometric designation.
Integration of the geometries from these domains results in the generation of multifunctional and multiscale conceptual designs.  
2. **Mapping**: The mapping of biological features to their respective tissue of origin initiates the search for alternative materials that replicate these biological properties effectively 

**Expandable Domain Integrated Design (xDID)**: The sheer variety of the biological features makes it impossible to classify them into a specific set of domains. Expandable domain integrated design (xDID) is an approach that facilitates the expansion by defining microdomains under each domain. For example, cellular structures can be further classified by the type of connections, such as beam-based connections and face-based connections.

### Meta-level design parameters

Meta-level design parameters are quantitative parameters that aid in the selection of biological features that have the same function and belong to the same domain. For example, sharkskin and dolphin skin exhibit the same function and belong to the same domain. Similarly, between pomelo’s peel and woodpecker’s beak that belong to the same domain.

### How does this work?

Based on the functional design requirements, biological features (multiscale structures) from different domains are combined to generate novel unique multifunctional, and multiscale bio-inspired conceptual designs. Following are the novel designs developed using the DID method.

1. A combination of Kingfisher’s beak from the cross-sections domain and barbs on the porcupine quill from the Surfaces domain resulted in the generation of a painless suture pin/leg design.
2. A combination of sharkskin and dolphin skin from the surface domain and honeycomb structure from the cellular structures domain resulted in the generation of skins for effective drag reduction and reduction in weight.
3.	A combination of Camel turbinates from the cross-section domain and micro-bumps on the Namib desert beetle from the surface domain resulted in the generation of structures for effective heat transfer and low-pressure drop potentially used in aerospace applications.
4.	A combination of woodpecker’s beak and pomelo peel from the cellular structures domain and snakeskin from the domain of the surface resulted in the generation of a non-pneumatic tire design for effective impact resistance and friction management.
